Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

Calculator is implemented on a stack, which I implemented
with an Array.

Usage:
	If you put an integer, the integer is pushed onto stack.
	If you enter an operator, two integers are popped, the operation is performed on those two integers,
		and then the result is pushed back onto the stack.
	If you enter ?, the current state of the stack is printed.
	If you enter ., the top element is popped, and displayed (useful if you made a mistake)
	If you enter !, the program exits. If stack is not empty, the stack is printed one last time.
Example:
	> 1
	> 10
	> *
	> -4
	> +
	> ?
	[6]

You can only call an operator if there are two items in the stack.
